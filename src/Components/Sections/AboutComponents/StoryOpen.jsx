          <p>
            I born in a little town of <span>Cappadocia</span>, Turkey where my
            family has been running a cute{" "}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery">pottery</a> workshop
            for generations. We basically craft the clay that we dug from the
            generous earth to shape into vessels and specific objects. I'm also
            an apprentice potter who's still learning the art in my leisure from
            my father. It's actually way more difficult than it looks from
            outside!

            Stray animals become an irreplacebla part of my life for last 4
            years! I cannot function well without getting their attention for a
            week! It's always a stress relieving for me to spend time with those
            little cuties!
          </p>

            enthusiast so much so that I've been started translating subtitles
            of them from English to Turkish since the highschool days! I have
            completed dozen hundreds of subtitles for Anime series that I loved,
            but I do it rarely now as I focudes on a full-fledged web developer!
