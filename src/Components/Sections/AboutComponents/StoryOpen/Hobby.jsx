          Stray animals become an irreplaceabla part of my life for last 4
          years! I cannot function well without getting their attention for a
          week! It's always a stress relieving for me to spend time with those
          little cuties!

          I'm also
          <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-anime-144982"> Anime </a>
          and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga"> Manga </a>
          enthusiast so much so that I've been started translating subtitles of
          them from English to Turkish since the highschool days! I have

          developer!
