          <p>
            I want to take a part of passionate, leading coding team that will
            help me to push myself even further and improve my coding abilities!
            I will build websites and applications that I've been wanting to do
            from the day one and hopefully apply for a start-up built in Silicon
            Valley, California in next 3 years after knowing that the efforts
            have been done.
